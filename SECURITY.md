# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Tawnia Healthcare Analytics System to protect sensitive healthcare data and ensure HIPAA compliance.

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Path Traversal Prevention (CWE-22)
- **Issue**: Multiple path traversal vulnerabilities allowing access to files outside intended directories
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive path validation using `PathValidator` utility
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `main.py` - Added filename sanitization and path validation
  - `src/routes/analyze.js` - Added safe path creation with validation
  - `src/routes/upload.js` - Added path validation for file operations
- **Protection**: All file paths are now validated to ensure they remain within designated directories

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention (CWE-79, CWE-80)
- **Issue**: User input not sanitized before rendering in DOM
- **Fix**: Added `sanitizeHTML()` method to prevent XSS attacks
- **Files Fixed**: `public/js/enhanced-app.js`
- **Protection**: All user-controllable content is sanitized before display

### 3. Log Injection Prevention (CWE-117, CWE-93)
- **Issue**: Unsanitized user input in log messages
- **Fix**: Created `LogSanitizer` utility class with comprehensive sanitization
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `src/analysis/analysis_engine.py`
  - `main.py`
- **Protection**: All log messages are sanitized to prevent log injection attacks

### 4. Missing Authorization (CWE-862)
- **Issue**: Critical endpoints lacking proper authorization checks
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive authentication middleware
- **Files Created**: 
  - `src/middleware/auth.js` - JWT authentication and role-based access control
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `src/routes/upload.js` - Added admin role requirement for delete operations
  - `public/sw.js` - Added authorization checks for service worker routes
- **Protection**: All sensitive operations now require proper authentication and authorization

### 5. Rate Limiting Fix
- **Issue**: Rate limiting counter always reset to 1 instead of incrementing
- **Fix**: Implemented proper counter increment logic
- **Files Fixed**: `src/worker.ts`
- **Protection**: Effective rate limiting now prevents abuse

### 6. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Created**: `src/utils/security.py` - Comprehensive input sanitization utilities
- **Features**:
  - Filename sanitization
  - Path validation
  - Input length limits
  - Character filtering

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with configurable expiration
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) with granular permissions
- **API key authentication** for service-to-service communication
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse and DoS attacks

### Data Protection
- **Input sanitization** at all entry points
- **Path traversal prevention** for file operations
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries
- **XSS prevention** through output encoding

### Network Security
- **HTTPS enforcement** in production
- **CORS configuration** with restricted origins
- **Security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Request size limits** to prevent resource exhaustion

### File Security
- **File type validation** with whitelist approach
- **File size limits** to prevent storage abuse
- **Secure file storage** with access controls
- **Virus scanning** integration ready

### Logging & Monitoring
- **Secure logging** with sanitized inputs
- **Audit trails** for all sensitive operations
- **Real-time monitoring** with alerting
- **Performance metrics** collection

## HIPAA Compliance Features

### Administrative Safeguards
- **Access management** with role-based permissions
- **Audit controls** with comprehensive logging
- **Information access management** with need-to-know basis
- **Security awareness training** documentation

### Physical Safeguards
- **Facility access controls** documentation
- **Workstation use restrictions** guidelines
- **Device and media controls** procedures

### Technical Safeguards
- **Access control** with unique user identification
- **Audit controls** with automatic logoff
- **Integrity** controls for data protection
- **Person or entity authentication** mechanisms
- **Transmission security** with encryption

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- Debug mode enabled
- Detailed error messages
- Relaxed CORS settings
- Local file storage

### Production
- Debug mode disabled
- Generic error messages
- Strict CORS settings
- Cloud storage integration
- Enhanced monitoring

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never log sensitive data** - Use LogSanitizer for all logging
2. **Validate all inputs** - Use InputSanitizer utilities
3. **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent SQL injection
4. **Implement proper error handling** - Don't expose internal details
5. **Follow principle of least privilege** - Minimal required permissions

### For Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS everywhere** - No exceptions in production
2. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regular security patches
3. **Monitor security logs** - Set up alerting for suspicious activity
4. **Regular security audits** - Automated and manual testing
5. **Backup and recovery** - Secure backup procedures

## Incident Response

### Detection
- Automated monitoring alerts
- Log analysis for anomalies
- User reports of suspicious activity

### Response
1. **Immediate containment** - Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment** - Determine scope and impact
3. **Eradication** - Remove threats and vulnerabilities
4. **Recovery** - Restore normal operations
5. **Lessons learned** - Update security measures

### Communication
- Internal notification procedures
- Customer communication protocols
- Regulatory reporting requirements

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- **SAST** (Static Application Security Testing)
- **DAST** (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- **Dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities
- **Container security scanning**

### Manual Testing
- **Penetration testing** quarterly
- **Code reviews** for all changes
- **Security architecture reviews**

## Compliance & Certifications

### Current Status
- **HIPAA compliance** - Implemented technical safeguards
- **SOC 2 Type II** - In progress
- **ISO 27001** - Planned for 2025

### Regular Audits
- Internal security audits monthly
- External penetration testing quarterly
- Compliance assessments annually
