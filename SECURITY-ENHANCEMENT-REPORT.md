- Enhanced file validation and processing

### 4. **Security Headers & CSP**
**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ Missing security headers
- ❌ Weak Content Security Policy
- ❌ No HSTS configuration

**Solutions Implemented:**
- ✅ Comprehensive security headers implementation
- ✅ Strict Content Security Policy
- ✅ HSTS with includeSubDomains and preload
- ✅ X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.

**Files Modified:**
- `main_enhanced.py` - Enhanced security middleware
- `src/security/security_config.py` - CSP configuration

### 5. **Dependency Security**
**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ Outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- ❌ Missing security-focused packages
- ❌ No security audit configuration

**Solutions Implemented:**
- ✅ Updated all dependencies to latest secure versions
- ✅ Added security-focused packages (helmet, bcrypt, etc.)
- ✅ Security audit scripts and configuration
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning

**Files Modified:**
- `package.json` - Enhanced with security dependencies
- `requirements.txt` - Updated to secure versions

---

## 🔧 Infrastructure Improvements

### 1. **Code Quality & Linting**
- ✅ ESLint configuration with security rules
- ✅ Security-focused linting rules
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for security validation

**Files Added:**
- `.eslintrc.json` - Security-focused linting

### 2. **Security Monitoring**
- ✅ Custom security scanner implementation
- ✅ Automated vulnerability detection
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite for security validation

**Files Added:**
- `security-scan.js` - Custom security scanner
- `test-suite.js` - Enhanced testing framework

### 3. **File Security**
